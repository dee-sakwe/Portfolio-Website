Testing Markdown!
================
The above was Headline lvl 1, below is lvl 2 and subsequent levels can be achieved by increasing the number of hashtags

Headline lvl 2
--------------

Theres two types of **Bold**: one using two asterisks on either side of the text and another using __underscores__ in the same fashion

You can also *italicize* using one of the above _symbols_ either side

~~Use tildes on either side to strikethrough, although this doesn't seem to work for me :-( (In the Preview)~~

> A "greater than" symbol followed by a single space is used to mark a quotation

Three consecutive dashes (space to differentiate from Headline lvl 2)
- - -
Asterisks
***
and Underscores are used for a horizontal rule!

Lists can be made using:
- Hyphens
  * Asterisks
    + or Plus signs. Cool!

1. You can also create ordered list items by starting with a number and a period.
2. Numbers don't really matter because Markdown will continue to the next one.

### LINKS
Just putting a link (https://www.linkedin.com) works

[Website Name in square brackets] (followed by www.link.com in brackets also works "link.com"(No space between them!))

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com "LinkedIn")

Images can be linked by adding a "!" before the normal link format

Use tickmarks to show a piece of `CODE`

```py
# Enclose code in three tickmarks to create a code block
# Also put a language reference so that it colour codes your code

def markdown():
  if True:
    print("This is a nifty way to showcase coding in Python!")
```
